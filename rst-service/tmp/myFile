FRED is a tool for automatically producing RDF/OWL ontologies and linked data from natural language sentences. The method is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar, Discourse Representation Theory, Linguistic Frames, and Ontology Design Patterns. Results are enriched with Named Entity Resolution (NER) and Word-Sense Disambiguation (WSD).
